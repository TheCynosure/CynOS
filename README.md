# CynOS
A Toy x86 OS that I am working on

## What does it do so far?
1. It boots from GRUB into Protected mode.
2. Then sort of can write to VGA Data, currently working on getting it to be able to change the screen to a single color.

tl;dr not much

I also will try and update the repository with alot of the material that I used to build this as I go along. Some of the files also have links to their sources if they are based on someone elses work. Most of them are.
