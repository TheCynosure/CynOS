# CynOS
A Toy x86 OS that I am working on

## What does it do so far?
1. It is able to boot with GRUB into protected mode.
2. Then sort of can write to VGA Data, currently working on writing to multiple rows in the VGA Data.

tl;dr not much

I will try and update the repository with most of the reference material that I am using to build this project. Some of the files also have links to their sources if they are based on someone elses work.
