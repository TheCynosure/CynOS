# CynOS
A toy x86 OS that I am working on

## What does it do so far?
1. It is able to boot with GRUB into protected mode.
2. Launch Basic C programs that I compile using my new fancy cross-compiler!
3. Write to the screen WITHOUT an archaic text buffer in boot_cyno!
tl;dr not much

What it currently looks like: (A little different now but same string and stuff)

I will try and update the repository with most of the reference material that I am using to build this project. Some of the files also have links to their sources if they are based on someone elses work.

Here is what I have used and benefitted from so far:
