# CynOS
A Toy x86 OS that I am working on

## What does it do so far?
1. It is able to boot with GRUB into protected mode.
2. Now can write VGA Data based on a text buffer in boot_cyno!
tl;dr not much

What it currently looks like:

I will try and update the repository with most of the reference material that I am using to build this project. Some of the files also have links to their sources if they are based on someone elses work.
